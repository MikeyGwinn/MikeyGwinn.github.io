        <h3>Challenges and troubles completing the assignment</h3>
        <p>
            One Challenge i had completing the assignment was dealing with file permisions on linux.<br>
            However after looking at the resources you provided and a little help from ChatGPT I was able to get it working.<br>
            Another challenge i ran into was just uderstanding the whole web development thing in the first place.<br>
            This being my first website all of this stuff is new information to me, and a new form of programming<br>
            always has its challenges figuring out the quirks.
        </p>
        <h3>What did I learn from the assignment?</h3>
        <p>
            Through this assignment I learned about basic HTML, like structuring a page nicely, adding images and links, etc.<br>
            I also learned about file permisions and posting things the the engineering webspace which was very interesting.
        </p>
        <h3>What Resources were most helpful during this assingment?</h3>
        <p>
            The resources I found that were most helpful to me were the links you provided for file permisions in the github repo.<br>
            The example html files you provided in github from class, and ChatGPT for aswering some inbetween questions.
